## SECTION 2: PROBLEM AGITATION

**Section Header:**
Let's Be Honest About Your Biggest Problem

**Body Copy:**

You know how to build websites. That's not the issue.

The issue is finding people who'll actually pay you to build them.

You've tried it all:
- Cold emailing businesses and getting ignored
- Posting on social media hoping someone notices
- Asking for referrals that never come
- Competing on Upwork against designers charging $50 for a full site
- Running ads that burn cash faster than they bring leads

Meanwhile, you watch other designers landing client after client and wonder what they know that you don't.

Here's what they know: **The best clients don't come from waiting. They come from making offers so good, people feel stupid saying no.**

And right now, there are millions of local businesses worldwide with no website at all. They're invisible online. Losing customers every day. And they have no idea how to fix it.

You're about to become the person who shows them.

## SECTION 3: SOLUTION INTRODUCTION

**Section Header:**
What If You Could Call a Business Owner With Their Website Already Built?

**Body Copy:**

Imagine this:

You pick up the phone. Call a local plumber. And say:

*"Hi, I noticed you don't have a website. So I built you one. It's already live. Want me to send you the link?"*

No pitch. No convincing. No "let me explain what I do."

Just a website with their business name, their phone number, their services—already done.

They click the link. See their business looking professional online for the first time. And you ask one simple question:

*"Want to keep it? It's $500 to set up and $99 a month."*

That's not selling. That's helping. And it converts like crazy.

**This is The Website Client Machine.**

## SECTION 4: HOW IT WORKS

**Section Header:**
How It Works (In 3 Simple Steps)

**Step 1: Import Your Leads**
Scrape Google Maps for any industry in any location. Plumbers in London. Dentists in New York. Landscapers in Toronto. Get 1,000 businesses without websites in minutes. Cost: $3.

**Step 2: Demo Sites Auto-Generate**
Our AI builds a demo website for every single lead—automatically. Their business name. Their contact info. A professional template for their industry. Zero manual work from you.

**Step 3: Call, Send, Close**
Open the built-in CRM. Call each lead. Send them their demo site via SMS or email. When they see their business looking that good online, closing becomes easy.

**That's it.** No hunting for leads. No building sites on spec hoping someone bites. No wasted hours on prospects who ghost you.

Just qualified leads with done-for-you demos, ready to close.

## SECTION 5: THE MATH

**Section Header:**
Let's Talk Numbers (This Is Where It Gets Exciting)

**Body Copy:**

Here's what a realistic week looks like:

You make 25 calls a day, 5 days a week. That's **125 calls per week**.

At a conservative 3% close rate, that's **~4 new clients every week**.

In a month? **15 new clients.**

If you charge our recommended $500 setup fee:
**15 × $500 = $7,500/month in setup fees**

If they stay on at $99/month:
**15 × $99 = $1,485/month in recurring revenue**

And here's where it gets interesting—that recurring revenue **stacks**.

- Month 1: $1,485/month recurring
- Month 3: $4,455/month recurring
- Month 6: $8,910/month recurring
- Month 12: $17,820/month recurring

**After one year of consistent calling, you're looking at:**
- **$90,000 in setup fees**
- **$116,000 in recurring revenue collected**
- **Total: $206,000 in year one**

And by month 12, you have **180 clients paying $99/month**. That's **$17,820/month recurring**—or **$213,840/year**—before you make another call.

Your lead cost? About $3 per 1,000 businesses. Pennies.

And you're not limited to one pricing tier:

- **Tier 1:** $99/month for the basic site (your foot in the door)
- **Tier 2:** $1,000-$3,000 one-time for a custom build
- **Tier 3:** $200-$500/month for SEO, maintenance, and premium services

Every client you close at $99 is an opportunity to upsell. We teach you exactly how.

## SECTION 6: WHY THIS WORKS

**Section Header:**
Why This Offer Is Almost Unfair

**Body Copy:**

Most web designers approach cold outreach backwards.

They call a business and say: "Do you need a website? I can build you one."

The business owner thinks: *How much will this cost? How long will it take? Can I trust this person? I'm busy. I'll think about it.*

And they never call back.

**But when you call with a website already built?**

Everything changes.

- No imagination required—they can SEE it
- No risk—it already exists
- No commitment—just "want to keep it?"
- No competition—you're the only one who did this for them

You're not a stranger asking for money. You're someone who already did the work. That shifts the entire dynamic.

**The demo site is the offer.** And it makes you uncloseable competition.

---

## SECTION 6B: THE REAL MONEY

**Section Header:**
$99/Month Is Just the Beginning

**Body Copy:**

Here's what most people miss:

The $99/month client isn't the end goal. It's the **starting point**.

Once someone is paying you monthly, they trust you. They see results. And they want more.

That's when the real revenue kicks in:

**The Upsell Path:**
- Client starts at $99/month for the basic site
- Month 2: "Want me to add online booking? That's $300."
- Month 3: "I can set up Google Ads for you. $500 setup + $200/month management."
- Month 6: "Let's rebuild this into a full custom site. $2,500."
- Ongoing: SEO, content updates, email marketing—$200-$500/month

A single $99/month client can easily become a $5,000+/year client. Some become $10,000+/year clients.

**And we teach you exactly how to do this.**

The upsell training shows you:
- When to pitch additional services (timing matters)
- How to position upgrades so clients ask YOU for them
- Which services have the highest margins
- How to package offers so the "yes" is obvious

Every client you close is an asset. The $99/month is your foot in the door. What you build from there is up to you—and we'll show you how to maximize every relationship.

---

## SECTION 9: URGENCY & SCARCITY

**Section Header:**
Why Only 10 Spots (And Why the Price Doubles After)

**Body Copy:**

We're not launching this to thousands of people.

Here's why:

Every new user gets the system personally installed. We configure it for your market. We walk you through everything on a 1-hour call. We make sure you're set up to succeed before you make your first call.

That takes time. And we'd rather have 10 designers crushing it than 100 designers confused and failing.

So we're opening **10 spots at $500**.

After those fill, the price goes to **$1,000**. Not as a marketing trick—because the demand will be there and we'll need to scale our onboarding capacity.

If you want in at the lowest price this will ever be, now is the time.

## SECTION 11: FAQ

**Q: How is this different from GoHighLevel or other tools?**
A: Most tools require you to manually build each demo site—15 to 30 minutes per lead. Our system auto-generates demo sites for every lead the moment you import them. You do zero site building. Just import, call, close.

**Q: Do I need technical skills to use this?**
A: If you can follow video instructions and make phone calls, you can use this. We install everything for you and walk you through it step by step.

**Q: What if I've never done cold calling before?**
A: We include scripts and training on exactly what to say. Plus, you're not cold calling with a pitch—you're calling with a finished website. That makes the conversation 10x easier.

**Q: Is this a monthly subscription?**
A: No. You pay $500 once and own the system. The only ongoing cost is the API for leads—about $3 per 1,000 businesses.

**Q: What countries does this work in?**
A: This system works worldwide. You can find leads and build sites for businesses in any country.

**Q: What happens after I join the waitlist?**
A: You'll get an email when we launch (14 days). First 10 people to purchase get access at $500. After that, price goes to $1,000.

**Q: Is a 3% close rate realistic?**
A: 3% is actually conservative when you're calling with a done-for-you demo site. You're not pitching—you're showing them something that already exists with their name on it. Many users close higher than 3%, but we use conservative numbers so you know the floor, not the ceiling.

**Q: How many calls do I need to make?**
A: We recommend 25 calls per day, 5 days a week. That's 125 calls per week—enough to close about 15 new clients monthly at a 3% conversion rate. It's a real business that requires real work, but the math is heavily in your favor.

**Q: What industries do the templates cover?**
A: We launch with 10 marketing-optimized templates covering the most common local business industries. These aren't generic themes—they've been refined over 10 years to actually convert visitors into customers. More templates are added regularly.

**Q: How long does it take to deploy a real website for a client?**
A: About 10 minutes. We give you AI website templates that let you build and deploy a production-ready site fast. No coding required. You can close a client on a $99/month demo and upsell them to a $500+ custom build in the same conversation.

**Q: Is $99/month all I can charge?**
A: That's just the entry point. We teach you how to upsell clients to custom builds ($1,000-$3,000), ongoing services ($200-$500/month), and premium packages. A single client can become worth $5,000-$10,000+/year with the right approach—and we show you exactly how.
